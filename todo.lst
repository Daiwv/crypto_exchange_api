ToDo-List:
==========

- rename btc-e package due to a naming conflict in eclipse?

- complete zapto client?

- rename TradeSite to TradeSiteClient and TradeSiteImpl to TradeSiteClientCore ?
  (but in most places, TradeSite.getDepth() etc. actually makes some sense...)

- implement the TradeSite implementation as separate jars, so the trade site 'drivers' could be loaded as modules?

- write a module loader for the trade site interfaces.

- refactor the TradeOrder/DepositOrder/WithdrawOrder structure, because deposit and withdraw subclass trade order now,
  but don't need a currency pair etc.
